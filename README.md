# Elevator-Simulator

STEPS TO RUN THE SIMULATION: 
1. Clone this github repository into your local filesystem and open it in an IDE of your choice
2. Get into the same directory as elevator.py, and type "python elevator.py" into the terminal
3. Follow the printed instructions in the console

FEATURES INCLUDED:
1. THE NUMBER OF FLOORS IN THE BUILDING MUST BE BETWEEN 1 AND 100 IN ORDER FOR THE ELEVATOR TO FUNCTION (doesn't make sense for an elevator to exist in a 1 floor building, and 100 floors is unrealistic)
2. THE ELEVATOR PRIORITIZES THE OLDEST REQUEST WHEN THERE ARE REQUESTS FOR FLOORS BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW THE CURRENT FLOOR

FEATURES NOT INCLUDED:
1. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT TAKE REQUESTS FOR FLOORS WHILE IT IS MOVING. IT MUST BE STOPPED AT A FLOOR BEFORE IT CAN PROCESS REQUESTS
